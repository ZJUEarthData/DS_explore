Package:
numpy、pandas、matplolib、sklearn、os、sys

Realization:
1. Gaussian Mixture realize clustering based on Gaussian distributed data
2. Outlier detection based on probability density
3. Contrast the GaussianMixture with four types of selected cluster shapes (full, tied, spherical, diag)
4. Commence learning and doing analysis over sklearn's existing data set 

Dataset:
【Hydrogen_test_classification.xlsx】: The 'TRUE VALUE' column in the data set is the actual category information

Further work that needs to be done:
Explore the influence of GM models with different cluster shapes on outlier detection
